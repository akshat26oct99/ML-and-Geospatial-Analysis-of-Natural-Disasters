# Geo Spatial Data Analytics for Natural Disasters

## Project Overview

The Geo Spatial Data Analytics project integrates Machine Learning (ML) with Geospatial Analysis to study and predict the occurrences and patterns of natural disasters. By leveraging advanced algorithms and geographical information, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the distribution, frequency, and impact of events such as storms, floods, earthquakes, and droughts.

## Objectives

- **Data Integration**: Collect and integrate extensive geospatial data to ensure accurate analysis of natural disaster patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Train and validate predictive models like Random Forest and Decision Trees on historical disaster data.
- **Visualization**: Develop interactive maps using Folium to visualize predicted disaster probabilities in real-time.

## Key Contributions

- **Data Collection and Integration**: Led efforts in gathering and merging extensive geospatial datasets.
- **Feature Engineering and Normalization**: Applied techniques to prepare data for accurate analysis.
- **Model Training**: Developed and trained predictive models to identify complex patterns and correlations between geographical attributes and disaster types.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Created dynamic maps with Folium to allow real-time exploration of predicted disaster probabilities, aiding stakeholders and decision-makers.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Decision Trees
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Folium for interactive mapping
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering, data normalization

## Impact

The project has significantly enhanced disaster resilience by providing actionable insights into potential risks. These insights support informed decision-making for disaster management authorities, researchers, and policymakers, contributing to effective disaster management strategies and resource allocation.
